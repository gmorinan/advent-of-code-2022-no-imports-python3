# AoC-2022: Python with No Imports

Not even using standard libaries like regex - everything done in base python.

Tried to keep it as simple and readable as possble.

Each script assumes it is being run from the same folder as that day's input file. 

Definitely not optimised fully - all 25 days together take ~148s to complete on my laptop.
